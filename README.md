<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I developed this template during my master's thesis in Engineering at the University of Pisa. The project is divided in three major sections:
- Frontmatter, which includes Frontispiece (generated with LaTeX package [Frontespizio](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/frontespizio)), Dedication, Abstract, ToC, Glossary, List of Figures and Tables and Introduction;
- Mainmatter, containing all the chapters of the thesis and the appendices.
- Backmatter, with Bibliography and acknowlegdements.

The backbone of the project is the main.tex document which includes all the relevant LaTeX packages and imports all chapters. Each chapter is developed in a separate file.
